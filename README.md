</div>

---

I'm a Full-Stack Developer who sees code as a canvas for creativity and problem-solving. Every line I write is part of a journey, one where curiosity drives innovation, teamwork encourages collaboration, and continuous learning keeps me growing. I transform ideas into real solutions, one commit at a time.

## ✨ About Me

```typescript
const safae = {
    role: "Full-Stack Developer",
    mindset: ["curious", "collaborative", "growth-oriented"],
    believes: "Good code = patience + clarity + practice",
    motto: "Learning never stops, neither do I"
};
```

- 🔍 **Perpetual Learner** – Every project teaches me something new
- 🤝 **Team Player** – Great things happen when minds collaborate
- 🚀 **Challenge Seeker** – Obstacles are just opportunities in disguise
- 🧘‍♀️ **Thoughtful Coder** – Quality comes from intention, not speed

## 🛠 What I Build

I enjoy working on projects that help me improve my logic, structure my thinking, and explore new tools.
From backend logic to clean and simple user interfaces, I try to focus on learning and building things with purpose.

Each project is a playground for:

- 🧩 **Problem-Solving** – Breaking down complexity into elegant solutions
- 🏗️ **Architecture** – Building scalable, maintainable systems
- 🎨 **User Experience** – Creating interfaces that feel natural
- 📚 **Learning** – Exploring new tools, patterns, and paradigms

## 📈 Current Goals

- 🎯 Improve my technical foundations
- 🚀 Build real-world projects that solve actual problems
- 🤝 Keep developing good habits as a coder and teammate
